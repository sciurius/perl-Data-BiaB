Data-BiaB

This module provides methods to read Band-in-a-Box data files and extract
some useful information from them.

Band-in-a-Box is an excellent tool for creating professional music and
accompanying tracks. I've been using it for many years but had to abandon
it when I phased out Microsoft Windows PCs.

Example:

    use Data::BiaB;

    # Load an existing song.
    my $biab = Data::BiaB->new();
    $biab->load("Vaya_Con_Dios.mgu");

    # This will show what was gathered.
    use Data::Dumper;
    print Dumper($biab);

An associated Data::BiaB::MIDI module is capable of generating a MIDI
file from the parsed data.

NOTE: Many BiaB files fail loading and parsing. If you have a recent
version of Band-in-a-Box its MusicXML export feature will be a much
better alternative.

This is a hobby project. It is pre-alpha, under development, works for me,
caveat emptor and so on. Have fun!
