 you don't need to install these scripts. But you might want to for easy use.
 just run ./install as root
 
 However, if you don't want to install the script, you have to set the
 ENV-variable BIABCONVERTER_TEMPLATES to the path where you keep your 
 copy of biabconverter and the *.lyt files.
 
 # export BIABCONVERTER_TEMPLATES=/full/path/to/biabconverter
