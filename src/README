-------------------------------------------------------------------     

 	a quick hack to parse Band in a box files.
 	based on the Delphi coded "BIABTools" of Alf Warnock
	
	It doesn't work with all files yet!!!!!!

	License: GPL

 	all user-customizeable values are located in 
 	biabdefs.pm, lilydefs.pm and mmadefs.pm
 	they are still incomplete! Please submit any new findings! 
 	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
biabconverter is able to convert most biab files, but most converted 
files will need some manual editing. Don't expect too much from this
early version!

  
NEWS in version 0.4
--------------------
-commandline options
-styleMap evaluated to structure output (unfinshed)
-Lilypond output is automatically converted to installed
 Lilypond version using convert-ly
-bugfixes  

WARNINGS OUTPUT
---------------
biabconverter prints warnings to biabconverter.warnings. This way the
important warnings are separated from all the ugly debug output.
Hint: use 'tail -f bianconverter.warnings' while running batch 
conversions

SONG DATABASE
--------------
biabconverter appends a line of comma-and-tab separated values 
to biabconverter.list. See biabconverter.pl for details on what
values are written.
This feature is useful when batch-processing a bunch of files

TROUBLESHOOTING LILYPOND OUTPUT
--------------------------------
The quantization is set by $smallestNote in biabdefs.pm to 1/8 notes.
It's still better to quantize in BiaB! 


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
-triplets are not properly handled by lilywrite.pm neither by quantization
-lilypond 2.2.6 doesn't display accidentials  (=> just remove hidden 
 notes at the end of the .ly file! This will break the 
 4-equal-width-bars-per-line rule.
-only 4/4 and 3/4 are known to work yet.  
-quantization only works properly in simple cases => You should quantize 
 already in biab before converting for now

THANKS to:
----------
Alf Warnock for reverse-engineering the BiaB file format 
  and for sharing his knowledge with me.
Matthias Neeracher for testing, improving and setting up 
  Mac fink packages
