-------------------------------------------------------------------     

 	this is a script to parse Band in a box files.
 	based on the Delphi coded "BIABTools" of Alf Warnock

	License: GPL

 	all user-customizeable values are located in 
 	biabdefs.pm, lilydefs.pm and mmadefs.pm
 	they are still incomplete! Please submit any new findings! 
 	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
biabconverter is able to convert most biab files, but most converted 
files will need some manual editing. 

NEWS in version 0.6.4
----------------------
-bugfix for mMaj7 chord in Lilypond
-new template band.lyt to allow to have sheets for different Instruments 
 in one PDF (only for lilypond >=2.6).
-no automatic usage of "convert-ly" anymore.

NEWS in version 0.6.2
----------------------
-bugfixes
-Lily Templates may be placed in ~/.biabconverter/templates

NEWS in version 0.6
--------------------
-simplified batch processing by cmdline arg -batch <dir> to process all 
 biab files in the given directory recursively
-biabconverter uses a template file for lilypond output now which may be 
 customized by the user. (thanks Matthias!)
-buggy install script fixed

NEWS in version 0.5
--------------------
-quantization completely rewritten and quite stable. not completely bug-free
 play around with -quant and -qtrip cmdline parameters if unhappy with 
 the result
  
NEWS in version 0.4
--------------------
-commandline options
-styleMap evaluated to structure output (unfinshed)
-Lilypond output is automatically converted to installed
 Lilypond version using convert-ly
-bugfixes  

WARNINGS OUTPUT
---------------
biabconverter prints warnings to biabconverter.warnings. This way the
important warnings are separated from all the ugly debug output.
Hint: use 'tail -f bianconverter.warnings' while running batch 
conversions

SONG DATABASE
--------------
biabconverter appends a line of comma-and-tab separated values 
to biabconverter.list. See biabconverter.pl for details on what
values are written.
This feature is useful when batch-processing a bunch of files

TROUBLESHOOTING LILYPOND OUTPUT
--------------------------------
The quantization is set by $smallestNote in biabdefs.pm to 1/8 notes.
It's still better to quantize in BiaB! 


KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
-lilypond 2.2.6 doesn't display accidentials  (=> just remove hidden 
 notes at the end of the .ly file! This will break the 
 4-equal-width-bars-per-line rule.
-only 4/4 and 3/4 are known to work yet.  

THANKS to:
----------
Alf Warnock for reverse-engineering the BiaB file format 
  and for sharing his knowledge with me.
Matthias Neeracher for testing, improving and setting up 
  Mac fink packages.
  Matthias has added lilypond template functionality
