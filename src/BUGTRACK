BUG
1970s/mamadont.mgu: locked loop in biabread 
biabread: stylemap entry at 374: 7
biabread: stylemap entry at 375: 32
=> biabread: until($i>=256) instead of ==
FIXED

BUG
/1970s/mamadont.sga: locked loop in biabread
Introduced a check for corrupted stylemaps
FIXED

BUG 
/1970s/cls2you.sg2: biabdefs: CRITICAL: don't know extension '100'
close-to-you.mma
leads to another bug: I think, when batch processing, not all values are reset in biabconv
for now I introduced "my $styleMap" but it might affect other variables as well
solved by modifying biabread object to include all data per object

BUG
/home/public/data/BandInABox/newrealbook/AS TIME GOES BY .MG1
causes locked loop
firstOnset:4294949239
Melody begins after 8947808 Measures and 439 

kind of solved the problem with  
if ($firstOnset>99999) {print "lilywrite: there seems to e a problem with the melody!\n"; 
  		&warning("CRITICAL: lilywrite: there seems to e a problem with the melody!");
		$hasMelody=0;}
FIXED

BUG
 /home/public/data/BandInABox/LRsongs/countryr.mgu
causes locked loop because  
lilyWrite: level would run too deep! returning with next note
=>didn't check, if last note was processed already!
fixed with:
    if ($lastNoteProcessed) {
    	#fake note
    	$note = new melodyNote(	$note->onset,$unitDur[$level],0, 0, $note->channel, 1, $diff); #is a rest
	return &newNotationUnit($level,$note);} 
FIXED
